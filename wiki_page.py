{| class="fandom-table"
|+[[File:Bigram table.png|thumb|alt=]]After a lot of analyzing of runes in unsolved pages of LP only conclusion we figured out is that LP is not coded by simple short key vigenere cipher (or monoalphabetic cipher).

Analysis of bigrams (pairs of runes) is the only deviation from randomness of other analysis results. It shows strange and unexpected low number of rune pairs with the same two runes. Somehow the key/cipher produces very few same rune pairs in the ciphertext. Same runes 2-grams happen but are very rare.

Its almost impossible that such low occurrence (86 same rune 2-grams in ~13.000 runes) would happen randomly using standard polyalhabetic cipher with most stream shift keys. Algorithm or stream key for some unknown reason cause this. '''This is so far only solid clue towards cipher/key found in runes.'''
